# Lowest-Eigenvalue-finding-Algorithm--parallel-solution-
The program is based on the publication J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2015, 11 (2), pp 472â€“483
It takes a test matrix and produces the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector. 
The algorithm is highly parallel and may be used for a variety of different scientific problems.
